/**
 * `daemon probe` — run the launch-verified capability probes on demand.
 *
 * The daemon refreshes capabilities automatically (at startup, on every WS
 * reconnect, and via a bounded background poll while any provider is non-`ok`),
 * so installing / logging into a provider is normally noticed without operator
 * action. This command is the immediate, on-demand path — it forces a full
 * re-probe + upload right now (instead of waiting for the next backed-off poll)
 * and surfaces the real, verbatim probe result locally. Each probe really
 * launches its provider (a 1-turn haiku query / a `codex doctor` handshake), so
 * this is not free.
 *
 * Probing is purely local and needs no First Tree credentials; only the
 * (default) upload step requires a logged-in client. So `--no-upload` runs as
 * a credentials-free local diagnostic. `--json` (or the global `--json`) emits
 * the capability snapshot as the machine-readable `{ ok, data }` envelope on
 * stdout; the human report otherwise goes to stderr.
