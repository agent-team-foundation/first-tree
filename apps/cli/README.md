# First Tree CLI

First Tree is the unified CLI for Context Tree onboarding, agent management, and team messaging.

Install the production CLI (macOS or Linux):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://download.first-tree.ai/releases/prod/install.sh | sh
```

After the installer completes successfully, connect this computer with a short
code from the First Tree web console:

```bash
~/.local/bin/first-tree login <connect-code>
```

The binary is `first-tree`; the short alias `ft` is installed with it.

For staging, use the staging installer and binary:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://download.first-tree.ai/releases/staging/install.sh | sh
```

After the installer completes successfully, connect with the staging binary:

```bash
~/.local/bin/first-tree-staging login <connect-code>
```
