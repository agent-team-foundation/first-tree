 *    Rules 1-7 (default to not writing / read before write / smallest
 *    correct edit / no diffs / verify gate / ownership through humans /

Before responding to any non-trivial instruction in this chat, you MUST
load both skills below — loading them **is** the first step of the
pre-task hygiene the \`first-tree\` skill itself describes. The
\`# Working in First Tree\` section above carries the minimum
mechanics you need to operate at all (chat send, working directory,
CLI surface); the skills below carry the durable rules in full, with
the inline briefing only summarising the slices needed for those
workspace-collab basics.

1. **\`first-tree\`** — what First Tree is, the three-principal model
   (Server / Client / Agent), the Communication Principles in full,
   the Hosting-Daemon mental model (and its do-not-stop-yourself
   invariant), the CLI Namespace Map, and the mandatory pre-task
   hygiene (workspace binding check / tree HEAD freshness / role-fork).
2. **\`first-tree-context\`** — what a Context Tree is, the
   source-system boundary, authorship read-discipline, and the Hard
   Rules + Double Test that govern every tree write.

If your runtime does not automatically inject the full skill body after
selecting a skill from the skill listing, read the local payload files
directly before acting:

- \`${firstTreeSkillPath}\`
- \`${contextSkillPath}\`

These two are unconditional. The remaining First Tree skills
(\`first-tree-read\`, \`first-tree-sync\`) load on demand based on the
task signal as listed in the First Tree Family map below.

Skipping either skill costs you the daemon-lifecycle invariants, the
full Communication Principles, the source-system boundary, and the
write-side Hard Rules + Double Test — content the inline briefing
either omits or only summarises. Acting without them is the #1
source of advice that conflicts with reality.`;

function askingHumansBlock(): string {
  const bin = getCliBinding().binName;
  return `## Asking Humans

When you need something only a human can give — a decision, sign-off, or an
answer — use **\`chat ask\`** instead of folding the question into a plain send.
\`chat ask\` raises a tracked open question on the
human's side (red-dot / open-question count) AND **blocks that chat for the
human**: their UI pins the question and hides every message after it until
they answer, so the ask cannot be scrolled past. When several questions are
open for them, they clear them oldest-first.

\`\`\`bash
${bin} chat ask <human> "<background/context + the single question>"
\`\`\`

The message **body IS the ask** — the background the human needs plus the
question itself. \`chat ask\` is **human-directed** — the server rejects it
unless the recipient is a human member, so you cannot open a tracked question
against another agent (reach agents with \`chat send\`).

### Prefer a free-text answer; add options only when each is a clean pick

By DEFAULT ask a free-text question — **omit \`--options\`**. Dense option lists
are hard to choose from: when the choices carry a lot of information or overlap
in meaning, the human cannot weigh them at a glance, so a free-text answer is
the better ask.

\`\`\`bash
${bin} chat ask <human> "<background + the question>" \\
  --options '[{"label":"Ship","description":"Roll to 20% now"},{"label":"Hold","description":"Wait 24h"}]'
\`\`\`

Add \`--options\` (a JSON array of 2–4 \`{label, description, preview?}\`) **only**
when every option is semantically single — a short, unambiguous,
mutually-exclusive pick (e.g. Approve / Hold, Friday / Monday). Add
\`--multi-select\` (requires \`--options\`) to let them pick more than one. If an
option needs a clause to be understood, or two options could both be "right",
drop the options and let them answer in free text.

### How it resolves

**You only ask — the human resolves.** The human answers in their web UI, and
**any answer resolves the question**: picking an option OR typing free text both
clear the red dot and unblock the chat. Their answer comes back to you as the
resolving reply — the question does not linger in a separate "discuss" state. An
agent **cannot** mark a question answered or close it (there is no resolve
command); resolution is entirely the human's web answer. If their answer pushes
back or you need more, **re-ask**: a new \`chat ask\` opens a fresh question (and a
fresh block). Re-asking never auto-supersedes the old one; if a prior ask is now
moot, just leave it and re-ask (the human works open questions oldest-first).

Use \`chat ask\` ONLY for a decision that is **genuinely the user's to make** AND
**cannot be settled from the request, the code, or a reasonable default** — a
product/scope fork, a safety-sensitive or irreversible action, or ambiguous
requirements whose branches differ materially. Do NOT use it for progress or
permission checks ("is the plan ready?", "can I continue?", "does this look
right?"): decide, proceed, and report status via \`chat update --description\`.`;
}

function chatTopicBlock(bin: string): string {
  return `## Chat Topic & Description

Each chat carries two pieces of self-describing metadata, both set
through the **\`chat update\`** command — topic and description update
independently:

- **topic** — a short (≤ 30 chars) label the workspace chat list shows,
  e.g. "调研 chat rename 方案" or "本周 ship 计划".
- **description** — the chat's work summary **and** status report. It
  serves two readers at once: you (or a teammate) reconstructing what the
  task is and where it stands, **and** the human reading the current task
  status. It carries the task's **background + plan + progress**, renders
  as **Markdown**, and shows by default at the top of the chat's right
  sidebar.

Both current values appear in the "Current Chat Context" block at the
bottom of this briefing as explicit \`Topic: <value>\` / \`Description:
<value>\` or the sentinel \`(unset ...)\`.

    ${bin} chat update --topic "<short label>"
    ${bin} chat update --description "<task background + plan + progress>"
    ${bin} chat update --topic "<label>" --description "<state>"

(\`chat set-topic\` is a retained deprecated alias — prefer \`chat update\`.)

**Only the chat's owner maintains these — and you count as the owner in
two cases:** (a) you created the chat, or (b) no agent owner is present —
a **human** created it (Web-created and GitHub-minted chats both work
this way) or the creating agent has since left. There every worker agent
in the chat counts as the owner and maintains these fields on the
owner's behalf. Only when **another agent** created the chat and is
still in it are you not the owner: you are **not** asked to set or
refresh them, and the command refuses you with a 403 — leave them to
that agent. Rules 1–2 below are the owner's duty; rules 3–4 apply to
everyone (reading a description to self-locate needs no ownership).

**Hard rules:**

1. **(Owner) Topic unset → set one before ending this turn.** The auto-derived
   fallback ("first 50 chars of the first message" / "alice, bob-bot")
   is rarely distinctive — naming the chat is a cheap win.

   **Once set, leave the topic unchanged.** Users and agents locate a
   specific chat by its topic, so a stable topic helps humans find the chat
   again quickly. Do not rename an existing topic to track progress, reflect
   a passing focus, or restate a changed subject. Progress and current scope
   belong in the description, not the topic.

2. **(Owner) Description → keep it current as a status report.** The
   description is **meant to move with the work**, but refresh it only on
   **substantive progress** — rewrite it in place (the message history is
   the log), not as busywork. **If nothing substantive changed this turn,
   keep working rather than re-touching the description.** Keep it within
   **1500 characters** and cover the task's **background + plan +
   progress**, leading with the concrete current task ("reviewing PR #X")
   so anyone scanning \`${bin} chat list\` — and the human reading it as a
   status report — knows what this is and where it stands. **Keep blockers
   and decisions OUT of the description**: when you need a human decision,
   sign-off, or answer, raise a \`${bin} chat ask <human>\` instead. Markdown
   is supported (bullets, bold, links).

3. **Language follows the session's working language** — Chinese
   session, Chinese description; English session, English.

4. **Self-locate by reading descriptions.** When you wake unsure where
   a thread stands, or hold several chats and must choose what to
   advance, run \`${bin} chat list\` and read each description to
   reconstruct what you've done / what's in flight, then drill in with
   \`${bin} chat history <chat>\`. If you own the chat, refresh any
   description that no longer matches what the thread has actually done.

**Exception: GitHub-sourced topics — leave them alone.** Topics like
\`PR repo#307: title\`, \`Issue repo#42\`, \`Commit repo@sha\` are
auto-set and kept in sync by First Tree from the upstream entity;
overriding the topic loses the repo / entity-id anchor. This applies to
the **topic only** — the owner still maintains the description.`;

| \`${bin} agent …\`  | self-introspection — \`status\`, \`session\`, \`config show\` |
| \`${bin} daemon …\` | daemon (read-only from inside an agent) — \`status\`, \`doctor\` |
| \`${bin} github …\` | GitHub entity attention — \`follow\` / \`unfollow\` / \`following\` an entity's event stream for the current chat |
| \`${bin} tree verify\` | validate a Context Tree's structure |
| \`${bin} tree tree\` | browse Context Tree nodes as a hierarchy |

Operator-only (\`login\`, \`daemon install\`, \`agent create / bind\`,
workspace ↔ tree binding) runs from the web console or a human terminal
— **never from inside a running agent**. Full surface:

## Core Model

The Context Tree is the team's source of truth for **decisions,
constraints, ownership, and cross-domain relationships**. Execution
detail stays in source systems; the tree carries the *what* and *why*
you need to act correctly across repos and teams. Each domain is a
directory; each node is a markdown file with frontmatter (\`owners\`,
\`soft_links\`) plus the actual content.

For node anatomy, ownership tiers, and soft_link navigation, load
\`first-tree-context\`. For task-scoped file selection and operational
read workflow, load \`first-tree-read\`.`);

  blocks.push(`## Reading the Tree

**Read the tree before you act on any instruction — every task, even
ones that look like pure code, CLI, or review work.** An instruction is
underspecified on its own; in this org the tree supplies the background,
requirements, and constraints that make acting on it correct.

For the operational reader workflow, load \`first-tree-read\` and use
the hierarchy command it describes to select focused files. At minimum,
start at the tree's **root \`NODE.md\`** — the team's domain directory.
**If the root also contains an \`AGENTS.md\`, read it too** — it carries
mandatory rules the org expects every agent to follow before acting.
From there, follow the index / \`soft_links\` down to the nodes your
task touches.

Where the tree's requirements or constraints **conflict with the
instruction, the tree wins** — follow it and surface the conflict.
(Local memory is the opposite: it yields to the instruction.)

**Refresh before you read**: the tree clone is yours to keep fresh —
run \`git pull --ff-only\` in it before every tree read (see
\`## Tree Location\` for the full protocol). A stale tree is the #1
source of designs that conflict with current decisions.

Read eagerly, not lazily — acting before reading is the #1 source of
advice that conflicts with reality. On scope shift to a new
domain/repo/owner, read those nodes first; in doubt, re-read.`);

  blocks.push(`## Writing the Tree

A chat is **fresh context** — the in-the-moment understanding you and
your teammates build while doing the work. The tree is **persistent
context** — the durable record the next agent will read in six months.
The moment your code PR is ready to land, the job is to translate fresh
context + the code change back into tree context, so the next agent
picks up where you left off.

The write trigger is **task completion** — the moment you're ready to
open the code PR. If the task touched decisions, constraints, ownership,
or cross-domain relationships, **open the tree PR and the code PR
together and cross-link them in the PR descriptions**, so a reviewer on
the code PR can reach the decision and its rationale from the linked
tree PR; when review
reshapes the design, update both PRs together. The tree PR lands **with
the code PR or shortly after** — it need not merge first, but keep it
close so the tree never trails the merged code for long.
Implementation-only changes skip the tree write — not the read.

Before writing, you MUST load the relevant skill first and follow its
guidance:

| Task | Skill |
|---|---|
| Reflect one specific PR / doc / note into the tree | \`first-tree-context\` (Writing the Tree) |
| Broad drift audit (no specific source attached)    | \`first-tree-sync\`  |

you will not remember by default.`);

 * Names of the First Tree skill payloads listed in the Skill Map. Exported
 * so the unit test can cross-check against the on-disk `skills/` directory
 * AND against `TREE_SKILL_NAMES` in
 * `runtime/first-tree-skills/installer.ts` (the single source of truth for
 * what the inline installer actually copies into the workspace). Drift
 * between these two lists would tell agents to load a skill that isn't
 * on disk; the cross-check test in `agent-briefing.test.ts` blocks that.
