/**
 * The `bin` dir to fall back to when a version manager's per-session `$PATH`
 * entry is gone, or nothing when the selected version cannot be established.
 *
 * The dir such a shell puts on `$PATH` (`fnm_multishells/<pid>_<ts>/bin`) is a
 * symlink that disappears with the shell, so it cannot be searched afterwards.
 * The binary itself lives in a stable version dir that does not move — the
 * problem is knowing WHICH one the shell had selected.
 *
 * The answer must never be a guess. Resolving a version the user did not select
 * silently swaps the executable and its context, which is worse than reporting
 * the provider as not found, so the decision is made across the complete state
 * rather than per root:
 *
 *   - The login shell reported exactly one manager. Only that is used.
 *     `$NVM_BIN` names the selected version outright and is authoritative,
 *     replacing any nvm enumeration. `$FNM_DIR` names only the active root, so
 *     that root — and no other — is consulted, and it answers only if it holds
 *     exactly one version. Default roots are not scanned at all: if we know
 *     which manager is active and it cannot answer, an unrelated installation
 *     is not a better answer.
 *   - The login shell reported BOTH managers. Which one was active was decided
 *     by the live `$PATH` order, which is exactly what is no longer available,
 *     so neither answers.
 *   - The login shell reported nothing. The default roots are scanned and the
 *     result is used only when there is exactly ONE safe candidate in total.
 *     Two single-version roots are just as ambiguous as one two-version root.
 *
 * It is a FALLBACK, not a preference: callers search it only after the
 * login-shell dirs, so a live selection always wins.
 *
 * Every root is vetted with {@link resolveOutsideProtectedRootsOnThisHost}
 * before it is listed, and every candidate before it is returned. Nothing is
 * trusted for being spelled like a version manager: `$FNM_DIR` is
 * user-controlled, and `~/.nvm`, a fnm data dir, or a single version entry can
 * each be a symlink — or sit under one — pointing into a protected folder.
