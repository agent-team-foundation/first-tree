/**
 * Chat-first workspace — membership lifecycle helpers.
 *
 * After the chat data model restructure (see
 * proposals/chat-data-model-restructure.20260512.md §8), "watcher" is
 * just an `access_mode` value on `chat_membership`, not a separate
 * table. Speaker ↔ watcher transitions are a single-table UPDATE;
 * read state lives in `chat_user_state` and is structurally isolated
 * from access_mode changes — there is no state-carry path anymore.
 *
 * Two distinct kinds of operation live here:
 *
 *   1. Per-agent / per-member recompute fan-out
 *      (`recomputeWatchersForAgent`, `recomputeWatchersForMember`).
 *      These translate an agent-rebind or member-status flip into a
 *      set of chat-scoped recomputes. The underlying chat-scoped
 *      operation `recomputeChatWatchers` itself lives in
 *      `participant-mode.ts` next to the speaker writer that owns
 *      the derivation invariant; we re-export it from here so
 *      historical callers keep working.
 *
 *   2. Speaker ↔ watcher transitions (`joinAsParticipant`,
 *      `leaveAsParticipant`). Single-table UPDATE on
 *      `chat_membership.access_mode`; `chat_user_state` rows for
 *      the (chat, agent) pair are not touched. Per §11.4 default,
 *      a fully-detached user keeps their `chat_user_state` row
 *      (read state remembered for re-add).
