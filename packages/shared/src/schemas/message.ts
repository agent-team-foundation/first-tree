 *                 session; includes AskUserQuestion answers submitted via
 *                 the web UI).
 *   - "cli"     — Agent's `first-tree-hub` CLI (`chat send` / `chat invite`
 *                 / etc.).
 *   - "api"     — Agent SDK direct API call (incl. result-sink auto-forward,
 *                 in-process tool integrations, AskUserQuestion publish);
 *                 the catch-all for client runtime-initiated writes that
 *                 aren't typed via the CLI.
 *   - "feishu"  — Inbound message bridged from a Feishu adapter.
 *   - "github"  — Inbound message bridged from a GitHub webhook.
 *
 * NOT a behaviour discriminator — use `purpose` for that (e.g. distinguishing
 * a CLI-typed agent send from a result-sink auto-forward, both of which may
 * carry source='api'/'cli'). `source` is the caller-stack origin, intended
 * for observability and loop / egress diagnostics.
